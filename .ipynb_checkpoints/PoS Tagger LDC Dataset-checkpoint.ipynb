      "this is one of the coldest places on earth the high arctic here the temperature drops to fifty degrees below freezing if i didn't have all this specialist clothing on the cold would kill me in minutes and yet there are animals that live here all the time and one of the most remarkable is hunting just over there an arctic fox the only reason that it and i don't freeze solid is that we're both mammals and have the mammal's ability to use our food to heat our bodies we're warm blooded the reason that it is more at home up here than i am is it has more of another mammalian characteristic hair than i have its body is insulated with fur warm bloodedness is one of the key factors that have enabled mammals to conquer the earth and to develop the most complex bodies in the whole animal kingdom in this series we will travel the world to discover just how varied and how astonishing mammals are we go to africa where the mammals are at their most spectacular here the plains are thronged with specialist grass eaters and there are other mammals here too with different tastes some hunting mammals have become the fastest creatures on earth and those they hunt have had to respond or die some mammals have become fearsomely strong and aggressive they fight for mates they fight for food some even have to fight for a place to live wherever you go you find a bewildering variety of mammals some are miniatures a few inches long others are massive and the biggest of those on land are dwarfed by those in the sea i can see its tail just under my boat here and it's coming up there the blue whale it's the biggest creature that has ever existed on the planet mammals are as at home in the water as they are on land some lounge around on the surface others prefer to do so on the beach we will go underground to track them and up into the tops of the tallest trees mammals have even taken to the air and challenged the birds in some places they congregate in astronomical numbers they thrive almost everywhere and how they do so depends as does so much in the life of mammals on what they eat between them they tackle everything that's edible some are very particular about their food others will simply take the best of whatever's around at the time on top of the menu right now is salmon we will look at the lives of our closest relatives and they will lead us to ourselves perhaps the most successful variation of the mammal's winning design to catch a glimpse of the very beginnings of the mammalian dynasty we must travel to australia i'm looking for one of the most ancient of all mammals it's so ancient it shares at least one characteristic with reptiles it's a very elusive creature but here in south australia there's a population that have been fitted with radio transmitters and i can track them with this aerial and i've got a very strong signal at first glance you might think that this mammal is some sort of hedgehog or perhaps a porcupine but actually it's weirdly different from a hedgehog a porcupine or almost any other kind of mammal it's an echidna and you can tell that it's a mammal because it's got hair and only mammals have hair indeed some of its hairs have been enlarged and strengthened and then turned into big spines which give it such an effective armour this hair helps to keep the echidna warm making sure that it doesn't lose valuable body heat to the cold air the fuel with which the echidna and every other mammal generates that heat is of course food on a cold winter's day like this the echidna spends most of its time searching for its next meal although echidnas have good eyesight and excellent hearing it's their sense of smell which guides them to food they sniff out insects and grubs and get at them by ripping open the nests and tunnels with their claws that beak like snout pokes into holes and then out comes a long sticky tongue that flicks into cracks and crevices to lick up whatever's worth eating echidnas are particularly fond of ants and termites and will even climb trees to find them this particular female has an unusually healthy appetite because she's about to breed and the way she does so is the reason why the echidna is such a truly weird mammal the echidna doesn't give birth to live babies she lays an egg it's hidden in her fur in a shallow depression on her underside it's no bigger than a marble inside it a young echidna is slowly developing after her baby hatches she carries it around on her underside for about fifty days until it begins to develop spines she then deposits it in a burrow where it stays and grows for nearly seven months but how does she feed it during this long time to answer that question we need to find the only other egg laying mammal in the world today and it too lives here in australia just surfacing beside me here is one of the most extraordinary animals so bizarre that when specimens of it were first sent from australia to europe people thought it must be a fake but it's not it's real it's alive it's a platypus that bill looks as though it should belong to a duck but it's not hard like a bird's beak it's rubbery like the echidna the platypus feeds on small invertebrates but it looks for them underwater once it's collected a mouthful it takes them up to the surface and grinds them to a pulp it doesn't have teeth but horny plates inside the bill do the job but how does it find that food underwater it closes its white eyelids tight so it can't see anything but it has a remote sensing device its bill as it sweeps it from side to side like a metal detector sensors in it pick up the infinitesimal electric currents that are given off by living things there were very few other mammals on earth one hundred million years ago when the first platypus appeared but there was another animal hunting in rivers birds as the platypus grubs around on the riverbed it attracts fish which the cormorant then snaps up water birds are among the most ancient bird families so this could be a scene just after the death of the dinosaurs when a new kind of animal had appeared on earth one with warm blood and fur the platypus has had enough she's heading back home for her breeding burrow for there at the end of a tunnel that may be twenty yards long safe in a leaf lined nesting chamber she's laid an egg exactly what goes on inside her nest no one really knew no one had even succeeded in breeding platypus in captivity until very recently we have bored very carefully a hole into the nest that lies below here and inserted this tube this is an optical probe with a little light on the end and i can manipulate it like this so that i can scan it if i then insert that inside this tube i'll be able to see something that no one has ever seen before aha that's her in close up there's her eye her ear it looks as though she's seen us yeah she's she's nibbling it oh not worth eating she doesn't seem particularly disturbed by it but has her egg hatched i think that quivering may have something to do with feeding i'll move the camera and see what's going on yes and there it is its milk milk is the perfect food it provides the growing youngster with everything it wants and only mammals produce milk in most mammals of course it comes from a nipple but in this very primitive mammal it simply oozes through the skin she's leaving off she goes the end of her furry tail but what's that among the leaves and there it is yes that's her baby i'll zoom in on it now you can see it a tiny little grub like creature it's naked and blind on its bill is a tiny spike that's an egg tooth that it used to cut its way out of its shell in just the same way as reptiles and birds do it can only be a few days old the platypus and echidna are the only mammals alive that lay eggs living links with the egg laying reptiles from which mammals are descended they're both so well adapted to their ways of life that they're still very successful and are widespread in australia that's an achievement for they've been around for one hundred million years as the fossil evidence makes clear most of that evidence is just tiny fragments but at riversleigh in northern australia it's a different story fifty million years ago australia was much wetter than it is today and just here was then a swampy area the bones of animals that died in or around those swamps became buried in limey mud at the bottom of the pools and are now preserved in limestone this rock is full of bone here's the rectangular boney plate from the back of a crocodile the rest of it looks as though it's bird bone but the limestone in which these bones are embedded is so hard that the only way to get them out is to put the whole block in a bath of acid for a few weeks the limestone then dissolves away and what is left is sometimes the most extraordinary bones beautifully preserved this is the skull of an extinct platypus about fifteen million years old it's been called obdurodon which means enduring tooth because unlike today's platypus which has no teeth this one still has them they're the empty sockets of the molars they're two little premolars but what was this place like fifteen million years ago when obdurodon was alive the night sky would have been full of the calls of animals in the surrounding lush tropical forests obdurodon would have spent much of its time swimming in pools but in the trees there were other mammals of a rather different kind marsupials there were many different kinds of possums very similar to those alive today down on the ground though there were less familiar creatures like this large marsupial leaf eater nothing like it is alive today there were great numbers of small mouse sized animals which judging from their teeth ate insects others had a taste for flesh preying on these small animals a marsupial lion which was certainly big enough to make a meal of an unwary obdurodon as the millions of years passed australia began to dry out the rainforests retreated and were replaced by grassy plains and as the landscape changed so did the marsupial mammals they thrived and diversified into many different species and are still abundant today they differ from the platypus and echidna in the way they reproduce instead of laying eggs they produce young without protective shells and this grey kangaroo is about to do so out comes not a shelled egg but a tiny underdeveloped little worm it weighs less than a lump of sugar it has no back legs but it has forelegs and they are just strong enough to pull it through its mother's fur it's started on an extraordinary journey to survive it must get to a pouch higher up on its mother's belly instinctively this tiny living particle climbs upwards against the pull of gravity and towards the smell of the pouch after about three minutes it reaches the lip of the pouch and clambers down to safety inside there it clamps its tiny mouth on its mother's nipple and takes its first meal of milk as it grows the ingredients of the milk coming from the nipple change to ensure that the infant gets exactly the nutrients it needs for each stage of its development by the time it's nine months old it's getting a bit cramped it's time to enter the outside world it's almost like a second birth he's a little unsteady at first but mum offers a helping hand now he's known as a joey it's all a bit much for one day and he heads back to mother's pouch it will be another year before he's fully independent other marsupials have taken to the trees koalas they too have pouches indeed it's the latin word marsupial meaning pouch or purse that gives the whole group its name when a koala joey emerges it clings tight to mother for several days before it risks going solo koalas feed on gum tree leaves eucalyptus but they're hardly an ideal food they're tough indigestible and full of unpleasant chemicals the youngster learns from mother how to pick the palatable leaves but even these contain little nourishment so koalas eat a lot and spend almost all their waking hours doing so and when they're not feeding they conserve energy they go to sleep only koalas can live on a diet of these particular gum leaves australia seems to be full of difficult diets in awkward places but there are marsupials that can deal with almost every one of them the vast continent of australia stretches from the temperate and sometimes chilly south right up into the tropics in the centre there are dry sun baked deserts where it's only too easy to die from thirst there are mountain ranges which in winter are crested with snow but the mammalian characteristics of warm blood and insulating fur enables marsupials to cope with almost anything the wombat has fur so thick that it can remain active throughout winter even in the coldest parts of australia it feeds on grass and other plants and the strong front limbs with which it digs itself burrows are equally good at clearing away snow to find food its pouch opens backwards so that the youngster doesn't get a face full of snow as mum digs numbats live in woodland but even there it can get quite cold at nights and this family are warming themselves in the early morning sun fur needs to be kept in prime condition if it's to function as an insulator so grooming is essential these dry eucalyptus forests may look unpromising as a source of food but there are plenty of termites numbats have just the right equipment to collect them that spectacular tongue has to be kept well anointed with sticky saliva and numbats spend some time making quite sure that it is with gear like that a numbat can collect twenty thousand termites in a day this creature's ancestors might also have used their tongues to collect insects but the mammal tongue is a highly adaptable instrument and now the honey possum uses it to gather pollen and nectar it's one of the most specialised feeders of all mammals its tongue has a brush on its tip which soaks up nectar from even the deepest flowers these boulders are home to a less fussy marsupial which will collect whatever food is around at the moment there's an unusual delicacy these moths sheltering from the summer sun the mountain pygmy possum might be small but it has a huge appetite moths provide a fast food snack high in energy rich fat and the pygmy possum will eat as much as it can and put on fat to see it through leaner times only the indigestible wings are discarded at other times the pygmy possum lives on berries and seeds picking them off with its nimble fingers the striped possum has a particular taste for grubs it lives in the few fragments of rainforest that survive in north eastern australia it's got all that's necessary to collect them an excellent sense of smell strong teeth to chew away the bark and a long sticky tongue but perhaps the most challenging of all australian environments is the arid hot desert at the continent's heart there is little to eat little to drink and few places to hide but marsupials have colonised this country too everybody would recognise those as kangaroos but the kangaroos belong to a very big family there are kangaroos wallaroos and wallabies big ones and small ones these are red kangaroos the biggest of the family they're particularly at home in this dry country this can be one of the hottest places on earth so red kangaroos don't have to worry about keeping warm their problem is overheating all mammals can sweat to lose heat but water is in short supply here and red kangaroos only do so when they are on the move instead during the hottest part of the day they make use of whatever shade they can find wiping saliva on their forearms helps to lose unwanted heat blood vessels are close to the surface of the skin and as the saliva evaporates the blood cools they only feed in the morning and evening when it's cooler when they do it's hard not to notice the extraordinary way by which they get about the tail acts rather like a fifth leg propping up the kangaroo as it swings forwards its huge hind limbs it looks ungainly when they're moving slowly but when a kangaroo senses danger the advantage of these unusual proportions becomes very obvious hopping at full speed a kangaroo can outpace a racehorse they're the only large mammals in the world that have developed this way of getting about but it's a very efficient way of doing so tendons in the back legs act like giant springs storing energy as the kangaroo lands and then releasing it to propel the animal forward by recycling energy like this kangaroos can quickly cover vast distances to escape predators or to search for food and water it's not just out on the flat that hopping works well some marsupials hop around on cliffs the rock wallaby's key to success lies in its feet the soles have thick corrugated skin pads which give them a grip on every kind of surface the wallaby can bounce about this difficult terrain with confidence there's little to drink here and though adults get the fluid they need from their diet growing youngsters may find that difficult this youngster is after an extra drink rock wallabies are able to bring up fluid from the stomach to ensure that their young don't go thirsty it's a special adaptation to this arid environment grey kangaroos live out on the relatively well watered grassy plains they are among the most sociable of all australian marsupials but living in groups can lead to problems in getting on together last season's joeys are fast approaching independence which means that their mothers will soon be ready to mate again males use their sense of smell to find out if a female is sexually available and will court her for several days having found one who seems to be promising a male stays close to her side to try and ensure that he and no other male mates with her the most dominant male is likely to be the one to father most of the next generation and that is worth fighting for joeys also fight but it's just play boxing a way of learning skills that will be important in later life but it's not always a fair fight fortunately this little one still has mother to see off the neighbourhood bully marsupials first appeared about one hundred million years ago towards the end of the age of the dinosaurs then australia was part of a great supercontinent but as the millions of years rolled by that continent began to split apart one fragment drifted south antarctica as it got closer to the south pole so it got colder became covered with snow and ice and its animal inhabitants died out a second part was australia it drifted north and got warmer and here marsupials flourished but there was a third part it too drifted north it too had a population of marsupials and they're still there that was south america it may well have been in this region of the supercontinent that the marsupial mammals first appeared many died out but there are still a lot of survivors this is one of the most elusive of them it lives in the streams of the amazon forest and operates only at night getting around in the blackness by feeling its way with its front paws and luxuriant whiskers it's the yapok or water opossum these pictures taken with infra red cameras may well be the first time it's been filmed in its natural environment it's hunting for fish and crustaceans its fur is so thick that its skin doesn't get wet it has webbed feet to propel it through the water it's too dark for even the sharpest eyes to see very much the yapok relies on its acute sense of smell and hearing to locate its food it swims with its arms apart groping for its prey with its highly sensitive fingers it usually takes its catch to the shelter of nearby vegetation to devour it but it doesn't only feed in the shallows the yapok has a large territory and there are many deeper pools in which to swim underwater it swims with its eyes shut like the platypus and hunts entirely by feel the female yapok can also shut her pouch and does so with such muscular strength that water doesn't get in and drown her babies though no doubt they must be close to suffocation after a few minutes of fishing it's been a good night's hunting and the yapok retreats to its burrow as day breaks the yapok is the only aquatic marsupial in the world most of the marsupials in central and south america live high in the canopy of the rainforest just how many there are up there no one really suspected until scientists started using cranes like this one apparatus like this gives such easy access to this high canopy that it's now possible to get an accurate idea of just how rich wildlife is up here while we might think of australia as the land of the marsupials in places this rainforest may have more of them than any other kind of mammal most of them are strictly nocturnal and though they are abundant they like everything else in these forests can be difficult to spot many are similar to this woolly opossum tree dwellers with few specialisations and a broad diet which can include flowers fruit and insects these marsupial mammals of course reproduce in just the same way as their australian relatives they give birth to babies at a very early stage in their development their pouch isn't as well formed as that of a kangaroo or a koala but their young survive clinging to their mother's underside marsupial mammals dominate australia and flourish in the forests of central and south america but alongside them are living a different kind of mammal a kind to which we ourselves belong and it's only that kind that you find everywhere else in the world the plains of africa for example have an abundance of mammals but not one of them is a marsupial they all reproduce in a fundamentally different way this wildebeest has nourished her baby within her by means of a remarkable organ on the wall of her womb a placenta it's a circular pad rich in blood vessels that is connected to her baby by the umbilical chord through which she has fed her growing youngster blood vessels from the baby run up through the chords of the placenta and pass so close to those of its mother that they're able to absorb nutrient from her blood and carry it back to the unborn infant but all this is about to change giving birth to such a large highly developed baby places great strains on the mother it's pretty traumatic for the baby too there's a great advantage in being born this way there are plenty of animals around for whom a new born calf would make a welcome meal but this mammal baby reared with the help of a placenta is able to get to its feet within minutes of its birth and while it's finding its balance its mother is there to defend it now the baby can be fed in the same way as all mammal babies with its mother's milk placental babies may still have months even years to go before they are fully independent those early months when they were protected in their mother's body have given these babies an invaluable start in life so whether mammals lay eggs or give birth to live young whether their babies develop in a womb or in a pouch they've managed to live almost everywhere the warm blooded furry milk producing mammalian body in all its multitudinous variations really is a winning design the duck billed platypus seems to me just about the most extraordinary animal alive in the world today i first tried to film it some twenty five years ago for life on earth we offered a generous grant to any scientist who could work out how we could peak inside the breeding burrow of a platypus there were no takers everyone said it was quite impossible this time with new technology we've managed to do just that and if you would like to discover how we did so and you're watching on digital interactive television you can press the red button and direct the action yourself and test your own abilities europeans first encountered the extraordinary platypus in one thousand seven hundred ninety eight two hundred years later we barely understand even the simplest aspects of its life piecing the evidence together has proved a fascinating detective story helping us unravel the mystery is platypus scientist tanya rankin\n",
